# Services

## Requirements & Planning

Our user-centered approach to project planning places emphasis on the needs of the users of your system. We select the requirements gathering and analysis techniques that are the most appropriate for your project.

Some of the services we offer include:

### Surveys
The Process Experience Architecture Groupoffers either open-ended or focused surveys, conducted online or on paper, based upon your needs.

### Interviews
We are able to conduct a variety of face-to-face or over the telephone interviews in order to gain insights into the needs and concerns of the users of your system.

### Focus Groups
This method is useful for discussing potential user requirements and brainstorming ideas among the various stakeholders of a system.

### Field Studies
are observations and studies of users as they use a system in a typical situation and environment.

### Task Analysis
Task analysis methodology investigates how users work within a system and is useful for analyzing how their work tasks should be supported by functionality in a system.

### User Personas
A review of typical users, their characteristics, usage situations, tasks and goals is detailed to ensure that all types of users and their needs are adequately covered by the system.

### Usability Goals
The Process Experience Architecture Group will help you develop usability goals for your project to focus and steer the design process, as well as to support the evaluation of early concepts, prototypes and final designs.


## Conceptual Design
The purpose of conceptual design tasks is to create a high-level user interface design framework. Typically these tasks include the development of mockups and diagrams representing the conceptual design of the system. These conceptual designs are then tested and evaluated.

Some of the services we offer for the conceptual design phase include:

### Card Sorts
Card sorting is a method used to help discover the structure in a set of conceptual items for a system. Index cards are used to allow participants to sort and label their own categories for analysis by the usability team.

### Task Flow Diagrams
Diagrams and flow charts are developed to analyze the specific details of work processes as related to the system.

### Information Architecture
This area of work within the development of a system includes the design of the organization, labeling, navigation, and searching systems to help users locate and manage information.

### Online Writing Guidance
Writing for online audiences is different than it is for print audiences. We can help you with guidelines and tips for effective content development.

### Storyboarding
These low fidelity prototypes consist of a series of screen sketches used to illustrate and organize system concepts for review and analysis.

### Prototypes and Mockups
A set of visual representations are used to clarify design ideas and rapidly create low cost screen designs that can be used for evaluation and testing.

### Style Guides
A user interface style guide can be used to help ensure consistency across a system and serve as a repository for guidelines and standards.


## Usability Inspection
In usability inspections our team examines a user interface based on a variety of different guidelines and methods.

Some of the usability inspection methods that we use include:

### Heuristic Evaluation
This is a method developed by Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich for structuring the critique of a system using a set of general usability heuristics.

### Cognitive Walkthroughs
Performing a cognitive walkthrough involves inspecting a user interface by going through a set of defined tasks to evaluate understandability and ease of learning.

### Standards-Based Review
In a standards-based review, a system is analyzed based on a set of standards or guidelines specifically relevant to the purpose of the system or needs of the users.

### Design Critique
A design critique is a method in which stakeholders are brought together with the usability team to review selected interface designs in order to gain feedback, discuss issues, and make recommendations to the designs.


## User Testing
### What is user testing?
User testing involves observing people using system to complete a set of representative tasks. Through user testing, we identify problems and issues; we then provide a report outlining suggested improvements and changes.

### Why user testing?
User testing is the best way to determine how well people interact with your system. It can provide valuable insights into the problems that real users might have, and offers the greatest potential for improving the usability of your site.

### What do we do?

Our user testing services include:

- Identifying and recruiting potential people to test
- Developing a testing plan
- Collaborating with you to develop a representative set of tasks
- Conducting testing sessions
- Providing questionnaires
- Recording the testing sessions in a format suitable to your needs
- Analyzing and compiling all session data

### What do you get?

Depending on your requirements, we supply:

- Comprehensive report including our findings and recommendations
- CD-ROM or videotape of "highlights" of the sessions (or complete recordings)
- Presentation to stakeholders and/or the development team
- Learn more about user testing participation.


## Eligibility & Fees

### Eligibility
Projects are accepted and prioritized according to their connection with University Information Technology Services (UITS) at Indiana University, with UITS projects receiving priority over others.
