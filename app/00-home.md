<p class="lead">The Process Experience Architecture (PXA) group designs web software for Indiana University.</p>

A team within University Information Technology Services (UITS), PXA designs student information systems and helps IT managers improve the user experience of their systems and websites.

## Approaches

### Requirements & Planning
Our user-centered approach to project planning places emphasis on the needs of the users. Some approaches include surveys, interviews, focus groups, task analysis, and user personas.

### Conceptual Design
The purpose of conceptual design tasks is to create a high-level user interface design framework. Typically, these tasks include functional prototypes, wireframes, card sorts, and information architecture evaluation.

### Usability Inspection
In usability inspections our team examines a user interface based on a variety of different guidelines and methods, such as expert reviews and design critiques.

### User Testing
User testing involves observing people using system to complete a set of representative tasks. Through user testing, we identify problems and issues; we then provide a report outlining suggested improvements and changes.
